# eresto-u

My first PHP project. The idea was to create an application that enables students to order their meal at a fictive canteen remotely so that the could still benefit of it during covid times.

This is a localhost version. You should have php installed, a web server and a mysql server running. Also, you should import the database, which can be done by importing the `.sql` file provided in the `bd` directory.
